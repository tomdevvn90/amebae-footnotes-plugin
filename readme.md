Shortcode options

You can modify some behaviours or styles of your footnotes by using the following options within our shortcode.
[af referencenumber=3]This footnote will have the number 3[/af]
[af class=â€™my-pretty-classâ€™]This footnote will have â€˜my-pretty-classâ€™ as additional class, allowing for custom styling of individual footnotes.[/af]
[af referencereset=â€™trueâ€™]This footnote will reset the footnote counter and therfore receive 1 as its number. Following footnotes will also receive their number according to this new start.[/af]
